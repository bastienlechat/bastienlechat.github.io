# About me

I am a Research Associate at the Adelaide Institute for Sleep Health under the 
supervision and mentoring of [Danny Eckert](https://www.flinders.edu.au/people/danny.eckert).
My research program aims to improve diagnostic and management of sleep disorders
for all, using technology including machine learning and wearables. I am particularly
interested in understanding the physiological mechanisms, consequences and potential
treatment target arising from night-to-night variability in obstructive sleep apnoea.

My PhD work addressed knowledge gaps regarding the consequences of disrupted sleep on health,
as well as using machine learning to detect and treat sleep disorders and 
their pathology more efficiently. I specifically focused on the impact of sleep
fragmentation on health and developed new biomarker of brain activity during sleep
predictive of [all-cause mortality](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1513/AnnalsATS.202103-315OC), sleepiness, and cardiovascular health.
